DisableArrowKeys
================

Sublime Text plugin to disable arrow keys.

This plugin disables all Sublime Text arrow key bindings. This plugin compliments the [EnhancedReadline](https://github.com/daytonn/EnhancedReadline) plugin which allows you to use readline-style keybindings to do all the navigation and editing you used to do with arrow keys.

While you could simply do something [like this](https://gist.github.com/ideamonk/4085062) yourself, you inevitably will need to toggle the arrow keybindings on or off (while pairing for example). Having these overrides in a plugin allows you to add this plugin to ignored packages to enable the key bindings.
